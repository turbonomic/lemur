# **Project LEMUR: Observability and Context** 
Developers can use Lemur and [Lemurctl](https://github.com/turbonomic/lemur/wiki/Lemurctl) to understand their microservice applications in the context of the stack, determining whether there are performance issues in application code or architecture, or whether the issue is with the underlying infrastructure.

>Find **Lemur set up instructions** on the wiki: [Lemur stack](https://github.com/turbonomic/lemur/wiki/Lemur-Installation) and [Lemurctl](https://github.com/turbonomic/lemur/wiki/Lemurctl)

### What's Included: Observability + Context
This free offering is a bundling of 3 observability tools, plus Turbonomic full-stack context. In a single UI, you can analyze your applications within the context of the platforms it runs on.

* Application Metrics via Prometheus/Grafana
* Service Mesh via Kiali
* Tracing via Jaeger
* Full-stack Context is provided by Turbonomic
