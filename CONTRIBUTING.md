# Contributing to Lemur

Contributing to Lemur is designed to be easy and most importantly, thank you for contributing!!  This is the getting started guide and will adjust over time as we add more automated testing to the build and commit process.

Lemur is Apache 2.0 licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub. This document will cover how to contribute to the project and report issues.

## Reporting Issues or Feature Requests

Your contribution through issues is very beneficial to the project. We appreciate all reported issues or new requests. They come in a few different forms described below. Before opening a new issue, we appreciate you reviewing open issues to see if there are any similar requests. If there is a match, comment with a +1, "Also seeing this issue" or something like that. If any environment details differ, please add those with your comment to the matching issue.

When **reporting an issue**, details are key. Include the following:
- OS version
- Environment details (virtual, physical, etc.)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected results
- Actual results

When **requesting a feature**, context is key. Some of the questions we want to answer are:
- What does this allow a user to do that they cannot do now?
- What environment is this meant for (containerized, virtualized, bare metal)?
- How urgent is the need (nice to have feature or need to have)?
- Does this align with the goals of Lemur?

When **submitting code through a pull request**:
- Include deatails about the fix/feature/documentation update you are submitting
- Seriously, it's that easy.  Pull requests are greatly appreciated and we thank you for your help in guiding the Lemur project community
